# FDTD_Waves
An example Finite Difference code for scalar wave problems in Matlab.
# Description of files:
* `OneDim_scalarWave.m`
  * Created for the purpose of fun!
  * Solves the 1D - scalar wave equation,
  * Backward Euler in time and Central Difference in space
  * Periodic boundary condition
  * NB: This is not an optimised code
  * Written -- July-2020
* `SinFuncExample.mat`
  * Example run for a sinusoidal source
* `DeltaFuncExample.mat`
  * Example run for a delta source
